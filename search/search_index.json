[01] Header image image Describes the area on the UI where the action or discussion occurs. [02] Topic title H1 header Each document has only one H1 header. This header appears in bold typeface at the top of the right-hand table of contents. Headers include an anchor link. [03] Top area admonition admonition This is an optional admonition to alert readers about the feature availability. This admonition has no title. [04] Internal link link A link to another document in Status Help or another H2 or H3 header in the same document. [05] Paragraph text Paragraphs are limited to a maximum of 60 words. [06] Sentence text Sentences are limited to a maximum of 25 words. [07] Info admonition admonition There are three types of admonitions, in order of importance: tip, info, and caution. [08] Section title H2 header Level-two headers group the different document sections. These headers appear in regular typeface in the right-hand table of contents. Headers include an anchor link. [09] Code format code We use a code-format typeface for certain variables to distinguish them from the regular text. For example: <code>Who holds</code>, <code>Is allowed to</code>, or <code>In</code>. [10] External link link A link to an external webiste. The link opens in a new tab and includes a trailing icon to inform readers is an external source. [11] Bullet list list Bullet lists convery relevant topic information. Procedure-type documents use \"What to expect\" title, while concept-type documents use \"The basics\" title. [12] Tabs tabs Tabs group information for a particular Status app platform o screen. [13] Interactive UI elements UI label Inside procedural steps, elements the user can click or tap use an icon first (if any) and the label name in bold typeface. [14] Second-level bullet lists list For steps with multiple options, options are grouped in second-level bullet lists. This element is rarely used and not recommended. [15] Procedural steps numbered list Procedures with steps (not tasks) the user should complete in a particular order use numbered lists. The number of steps is limited to six or seven per procedure. [16] Screenshot image Screeshosts guide users to the proper screen, and describe UI elements or UI interactions requiring multiple steps. [17] Internal admonition admonition When using a tabbed interface, this admonition is visible only selecting one of the tabs. This helps to clarify information for a particular tab only. [18] Tip admonition admonition There are three types of admonitions, in order of importance: tip, info, and caution. [19] Substeps H3 header For procedural steps with more than 6-7 steps, we split the procedure into subprocedures. H3 is the minimum header level on our docs. Level-three headers don't appear in the right-hand table of contents. Headers include an anchor link. [20] Procedural steps in a table numbered list Some proceral steps go inside tables.  [21] Table table Any topic (procedure, concept, or reference) can include a table to summarize different information. [22] Legend text A short legend explaining the numbers or figures on the table. [23] Internal link A link to antoher part of the same document. Procedural steps may include internal links but never include external links. [24] Admonition admonition In procedures, admonition go after the procedure or screenshot (if any). [25] Tooltip tooltip A short description of a term that pops-up when the user taps (mobile) or hovers over the term (desktop). [26] Checkboxes checkbox Procedures with more or less complex tasks (not steps) the user must complete, not necessarily in an orderly fashion. [27] Caution admonition admonition There are three types of admonitions, in order of importance: tip, info, and caution. [28] Common questions H2, H3 headers Some documents include this section at the end, with each question in a different H3 header. -- Date, Authors information metadata Articles include the date of last update, or creation date if there is no update. Additionally, articles include the GitHub avatar of up to three different authors. Clicking on the author avatar opens their GitHub profile page. -- Like, Dislike button buttons Provides users a way to send feedback about the document. <p> Procedural steps inside tables should have the same format as procedural steps outside tables. At this time, we haven't updated the static site generator to achieve this functionality.</p>"},{"location":"document-example-with-all-components/","title":"Document example","text":"<p> [01]</p>"},{"location":"document-example-with-all-components/#doc-example-with-all-markdown-components","title":"Doc example with all Markdown components","text":"<p>[02]</p> <p>Dream of the mind's eye invent the universe from which we spring with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence concept.
